# Tafferugli
{: .fs-9 }

A Twitter Analysis Framework.
{: .fs-6 }


Tafferugli is a Twitter Analysis Framework in the form of a web application that is able to **filter**, **collect** and **analyze** tweets. 

It is thought as a tool to facilitate analysis of some phenomena related to propaganda operations, such as **coordinated behavior** and **automated posting**.

It comes with a set of default **metrics** already implemented, and the possibility of adding custom metrics with little python code.
